# I2C slave library for the Raspberry Pi Pico

The Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK has all you need to write an I2C master, but is curiously lacking when it comes to I2C in slave mode. This library fills that gap to easily turn the Pico into an I2C slave.

## Examples

An example program is included where the slave acts as a 256 byte external memory. See `example_mem`.

For those who prefer the Wire API commonly used with Arduino, there is a second version on top of a Wire wrapper. See `example_mem_wire`.

To keep it simple, both master and slave run on the same board. Just add jumpers between the two I2C instances: GP4 to GP6 (SDA), and GP5 to GP7 (SCL). 

### Setup

Follow the instructions in [Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) to setup your build environment. Then:

- `git clone https://github.com/vmilea/pico_i2c_slave`
- `cd pico_i2c_slave`
- `mkdir build`, `cd build`, `cmake ../`, `make`
- copy `example_mem/example_mem.uf2` to Raspberry Pico
- open a serial connection and check output
